  <description>Version 17.0 for a17.1546
  
  This mod adds a new tab that conveniently lists all wild animals. Animals belonging to a faction are excluded from this list (with the exception of the insectoid faction).
      
  The version on the steam workshop will always target the latest stable release of RimWorld. Previous and unstable versions as well as the source for my mods can be found on github:
